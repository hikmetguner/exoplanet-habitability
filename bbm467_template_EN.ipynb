    "Clustering exoplanets using machine learning in order to gather insight about potentially habitable planets outside of our solar system.\n",
    "Considering the fact that even the closest planets outside of the solar system are unreachable, there is no way to classify a planet as habitable or not with accuracy. However, there are some key elements which are considered necessary for habitability. The aim of this project is to gather insight of how grouping planets, without making any habitability indicing calculations, could affect filtering based on habitability. The dataset used for this project is directly fetched from NASA's exoplanet archive, which will be clustered for further analysis. The results could be utilized to filter out false positives, saving time and resources which would be spent on those planets otherwise.\n"

    "Considering the fact that the tools used to identify exoplanets are biased, it seems plausible to begin the analysis without any prior knowledge of the planet, where the algorithm only groups planets that correleate. Then, from these correleations, more insight could be gained on placing key plantes which are known to be habitable or close to be habitable, such as Earth and Mars. However, these results should not be taken at face value, they exist simply to filter unwanted planets or false positives as much as possible."
